My Project for Unit 1 APCSA
# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built in Neightborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

My project is a simple but meaningful project to me. I painted stripes across the grid, but each color represents someone in my family. I asked my family members what their favorite colors were for the first run down, then I chose colors that reminded me of them for the stripes that go up. To begin it, I asked my Mom, Dad, brother, and sister. Their Favorite colors are green, pink, red, and blue. I then went in for a second layer and chose colors that I thought of when I thought about them. Those colors were light blue, yellow, orange, and wite. I chose these colors becuase they are all bright and somewhat related to a personal experience I had with each of them.

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

I am proud of the fact that
